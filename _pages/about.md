About Me
======
I am a PhD candidate at University of Amsterdam (UvA), working with Prof. [Dimitris Tzionas](https://dtzionas.com/).

My research interests are in Computer Vision, Graphics, and Machine Learning, with a focus on __human motion generation__ and __human-object interaction synthesis__.

-----------

Before joining UvA, I was a predoctoral student at Institut de Robòtica i Informàtica Industrial (CSIC-UPC), working with Dr. [Francesc Moreno-Noguer](https://www.iri.upc.edu/people/fmoreno/) and Dr. [Jordi Sanchez](https://jsan3386.github.io/).

In 2024 I interned at Amazon Science.

Prior to my stay at CSIC-UPC, I completed a master's with honors from Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB), working with Dr. [Francesc Moreno-Noguer](https://www.iri.upc.edu/people/fmoreno/) and Dr. [Adrian Lopez-Rodriguez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2UqN6M0AAAAJ&hl=en) on 3D human avatar reconstruction. As a bachelor's student, I worked on sign language understanding from video with Dr. [Xavier Giró](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M3ZUEc8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Laia Tarrés](https://laiatarres.github.io/).
