About Me
======
I am a PhD candidate at Institut de Robòtica i Informàtica Industrial (CSIC-UPC), working with Dr. [Francesc Moreno-Noguer](https://www.iri.upc.edu/people/fmoreno/) and Dr. [Jordi Sanchez](https://jsan3386.github.io/).

I am interning at Amazon Science Berlin till the end of the year.

My current research interests are in Computer Vision, Graphics, and Machine Learning, with a focus on 3D reconstruction and understanding of rigid and nonrigid shapes, human avatars, and human-scene interaction.
My aspirational PhD goal for 3D vision is to design computational models that will allow machines to perceive, understand and interact with the world in an embodied fashion through virtual humans. As 3D data is expensive and scarce, this will probably require the use of 2D data, and robust learning and generation from limited information.

Prior to joining CSIC-UPC in October 2023, I completed a master's with honors from Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB), working with Dr. [Francesc Moreno-Noguer](https://www.iri.upc.edu/people/fmoreno/) and Dr. [Adrian Lopez-Rodriguez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2UqN6M0AAAAJ&hl=en) on 3D human avatar reconstruction. As a bachelor's student, I worked on sign language understanding from video with Dr. [Xavier Giró](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M3ZUEc8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Laia Tarrés](https://laiatarres.github.io/).

I am on the look out to pursue a PhD in 3D computer vision with the aspirational goal of designing computational models that will allow machines to perceive and understand the world from potentially sparse inputs. More precisely, I am interested in the topics of 3D modelling, semantic recognition, and robust learning and generation from limited information.
